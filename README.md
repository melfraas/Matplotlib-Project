# Matplotlib-Project
Matplotlib assignment for bootcamp
Using a mock dataset of two treatment regimens on tumors in mice, the objective of this assignment was to demonstrate understanding of various functions within MatPlotLib, Pandas, and statistical significance. Results of the drug treatment regimens are visualized using various plot types.  Linear regression is used to evaluate the correlation between the final tumor volume and each drug regimen.
